     Miles Morales first appeared 
    in Ultimate Fallout #4 (August 2011), 
    following the death of Peter Parker. 
    The 13-year-old biracial teenage son of an 
    African-American father and a Puerto Rican mother, 
    he is the second Spider-Man to appear in Ultimate Marvel,
    an imprint with a separate continuity from the mainstream
    Marvel Universe called the Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610).
    [6] He was featured in the Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man comic 
    book series, and after Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, 
    Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616), 
    beginning with stories under the All-New, All-Different Marvel 
    branding that debuted that same year, with the older native 616-Morales
    ultimately being established as the character's archenemy: Ultimatum. 
    The character was not the lead character in the Ultimate Spider-Man
    animated television series on but he was later added to the main cast,
    as Kid Arachnid,[7] and featured the main protagonist in the 2018 animated 
    feature film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse which won the Academy Award 
    for Best Animated Feature, and its 2023 and 2024 sequels.</span>
