    <p><span style="color: darkgoldenrod;"> Miles possesses similar spider-based abilities as Peter Parker; he has the proportionate strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes of a spider. He can lift up to ten tons, leap several stories, move much faster than the average human, and is generally more resistant to injury or fatigue than normal people. Why does Miles Morales (Spider-Man) get special abilities like electricity and invisibility? It was a genetically engineered spider created to replicate Spider-Man's abilities and managed to get to Miles and ofc bite him. one of my favorite powers of miles is Bio-electricity is an ability introduced in Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Also known as Venom Blast, using the ability allows Miles to both stockpile huge amounts of electrical energy and release it at will.</span></p>
